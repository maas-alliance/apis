  title: MaaS API
  description:
    The MaaS API is a spec for a web service that let's you plan door-to-door
    trips using a large variety of public and private transport. It 
    integrates real-time information and allows users to book and pay
    for transport.<br/>
    <br/>
    In Mobility as a Service (MaaS) terms, this API is to be exposed by a MaaS 
    Operator or by a MaaS Integrator, rather than by a transport service 
    provider (TSP). This API covers multiple TSPs across a variety of 
    transport modes and focusses on A-to-B trips.<br/>
    <br/>
    This API spec is based on the <a href="https://github.com/skedgo/tripgo-api">TripGo API</a>, copyright 2018 SkedGo Pty Ltd.

      summary: Departure timetable for stop
      description: |
        Gets the departure timetable for a provided list of transit stops. It returns the next `limit` departures after `timeStamp` across any of the provided `embarkationStops`. If multiple stops are provided, the returned services might therefore only cover a subset of the provided stops.

        If `disembarkationStops` is provided, then the returned timetable covers only services between any of the embarkation stops and any of the disembarkation stops. If the region of the embarkation stops and the region of the disembarkations stops is not the same, then you must specify the `disembarkationRegionID` of the `disembarkationStops`.

        Note that the the stop codes in the embarkation stops might *not* match the stop codes provided in the input. This happens if the input specified the stop code of a "parent" station (e.g., a major train station) but all the departures are from one of the parent station's "children" (e.g., a platform of that train station). If that's the case, then the `parentInfo` array will provide additional information on the parent station and its children.

        Details of the specific route that a service takes.

        Which stops are included in the `stops` list depends on the `travelled` status of the segment. For travelled segments, all stops including embarkation and disembarkation are included. Non-travelled segments however exclude the embarkation and disembarkation (as those would have been part of the travelled shape already).

        If there's a train from A to H and the travelled part is C to F, which changes its service identifier at E, we end up with 4 segments. 1) non-travelled with `A+B`, 2) travelled with `C+D`, 3) travelled with `E+F`, 4) non-travelled with `G+H`.

          description: is used to report back to the backend which trip a user intends to take or is currently taking. The trip then gets added to an internal anonymised database, which we use in for analytics to infer general usage patterns. It is a short-cut that avoids having to send detailed information about the trip (as our backend already has the details of the trip). It is entirely optional for you to use – if you do, we should have a chat, as we can then provide a dedicated database for you, in case you want to analyse this kind of usage data.
